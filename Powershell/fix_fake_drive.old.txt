# PowerShell commands to fix fake USB drive
# Run these in Administrator PowerShell

# IMPORTANT NOTES ABOUT FILE SIZE LIMITS:
# 
# 1. FAT32 File System Limit: Individual files cannot exceed 4GB
#    - This is a file system limitation, not related to drive capacity
#    - Any single file larger than 4GB will be rejected automatically
#
# 2. Drive Capacity Protection: 
#    - The 4GB partition protects against writing to fake sectors
#    - Windows will show "Not enough space" when the 4GB is full
#    - This prevents any data from being written to fake/dangerous areas
#
# 3. Data Safety:
#    - Existing files: The Clear-Disk command removes ALL existing data
#    - New files: Cannot exceed 4GB individually (FAT32 limit)
#    - Total capacity: Cannot exceed 4GB total (partition size limit)
#
# 4. Double Protection:
#    - FAT32: Blocks individual files > 4GB
#    - Partition size: Blocks total data > 4GB
#    - Both protect against writing to fake sectors

# First, identify the disk number
Get-Disk | Where-Object {$_.BusType -eq "USB"} | Format-Table Number, FriendlyName, Size

# Replace X with your actual disk number from above
$DiskNumber = X

# Clean the disk completely
Clear-Disk -Number $DiskNumber -RemoveData -Confirm:$false

# Create a new partition with only 4GB (4096MB) to stay within real storage
New-Partition -DiskNumber $DiskNumber -Size 4GB -AssignDriveLetter M

# Format the new 4GB partition
Format-Volume -DriveLetter M -FileSystem FAT32 -NewFileSystemLabel "USB_DRIVE" -Force

# Verify the result
Get-Partition -DiskNumber $DiskNumber
Get-Volume -DriveLetter M
